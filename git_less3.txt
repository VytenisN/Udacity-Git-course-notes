-> It makes sense to keep a backup of my code in a cloud

-> You run "fork" when you want to copy a project in GitHub, "clone" when You clote to local repository.

-> In order to share unfinished code, you should create new branch push it, receive feedback and merge it to master using pull request

-> Pull request is asking the collaborator to pull modified branch into master branch

-> It looks easier to collaborate on GitHub, because it is easy to see what the other person changed, fix mistakes and add code to the project.
