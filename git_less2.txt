-> When repository is initialized, empty git structure is created in order to commit files to git.

-> Staging area is a temporary area before commit. It offers to review and group files as you wish, before commiting to git.

-> Branches would be helpful when adding experimental features or different versions from the main one. Master branch is working, all others are on working mode.

-> Diagrams help to navigate in the git much easier and not get lost or lose some commits.

-> Merging branches combines new lines with deleted ones in any of commits. It makes a branch merge to another.

-> Branch label is deleted after merge, but the commits remain.
